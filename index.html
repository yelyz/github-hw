        <strong>1. It's eco-friendly.</strong><br />
        Fast fashion is currently a major environmental concern. With the rise
        of affordable mass-produced clothing brands, buying more clothes than
        you'll wear, or buying low-quality trendy pieces to throw away next
        season became common. "But people enjoy fashion, you can't just wear the
        same two shirts over and over!" Well, thrift shopping to the rescue -
        here you're not only buying whatever you want without affecting the
        demand for fast-fashion, but also reducing the amount of clothes that
        end up on landfills. Reduce, reuse, recycle - and thrift shopping covers
        all three!
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        <strong>2. It's cheap.</strong><br />
        Well, this one is pretty self-explanatory. Buying used clothes is
        cheaper than buying brand-new. Of course, with thrift shopping rising in
        popularity, some shops' prices have skyrocketed - especially those that
        offer (or at least claim to offer) vintage clothing. But finding good
        old-fashioned thrift shops with cheap clothes is still relatively easy.
        And if there are none in your area - online thrift platforms are an
        amazing option instead!

        <strong>
          3. It's an opportunity to revisit and redesign previous fashion
          trends.
        </strong>
        <br />
        Fashion has a tendency to change pretty rapidly, and with fast fashion
        allowing easy access to cheap clothes that you can wear for a short
        period of time and then throw away, this tendency is only picking up
        speed. This means that a lot of trends are forgotten about as quickly as
        they are introduced. Thrifting clothes allows us to revisit those trends
        when they've lost some of their popularity - and maybe even put our own
        twist on them!
